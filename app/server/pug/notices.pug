		h2 Transparency
		p.cont
			| Detailed stats give us valuable insight into how we play quizbowl, 
			| just as how analytics gives website owners insight into user experience.
		p
			| If you use an ad blocker or anti-tracker that blocks Google Analytics, please consider turning it off for this website. 
			| I rely on interaction data to improve it.

		h2 About every.buzz/jank
		p.cont
			| This is a temporary, static preview of #[a(href='/') every.buzz], a website for visualizing detailed quizbowl stats 
			| currently being developed by Ophir Lifshitz.
		p
			| It was privately released on December 7, 2018, and first published on January 5, 2019. 
			| More data and features will be added later.

		h2 Contributing
		p
			| This very simple website is built with Express (Node, Pug, Coffee, Sass). 
			| Project development takes place on the #[a(href='https://github.com/hftf/belgrade') GitHub repository].
		p.cont
			| If you would like to hack on it, ask me for the database (SQLite) and packets (which will be posted on GitHub soon).
		p
			| Adding new features and stats is easy if you are competent in SQL; no frontend or backend experience is necessary.

		h2 Errata
		p
			| Follow #[a(href='https://minkowski.space/quizbowl/manuals/scorekeeping/player.html#errata') these instructions] to report errata.

		h2 Thanks
		p.cont
			| I would like to thank to all volunteers for staffing and for putting up with an unusual system. 
			| My goal is to improve the experience of every player and moderator.
		p
			| Thanks to their efforts, editors have been able to make many informed improvements to their sets between mirrors, 
			| and we’ve all learned much more about question playability.
		p
			| Many thanks to the following contributors for their work improving this website:
			dl.grid
				dt Jordan Brownstein
				dd instant search and indexing (March 2019)
